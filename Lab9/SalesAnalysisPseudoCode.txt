Lab 9 Sales Analysis Pseudocoding

SalesAnalysisDemo (Main) class
1) Ask the user for the file name/path
2) Use a while pit to test if file exists
3) Create a SalesAnalysis object via passing in the file name/path
4) Call processFile()
5) Call writeOutput()

SalesAnalysis
1) Set up field vars - ArrayList Double type called weeklyNumber, String inputFile
2) Create a public static int constant for DAYS_OF_WEEK set to 7
3) Create a constructor that sets inputFile

+processFile()-void
NOTE-OK to create local vars inside the method
1) Create a file object and create a Scanner object with the file object
2) While Scanner object hasNextLine
	a) Get the line
	b) Split the line to create a String array
	c) Call setArrayListElement passing in the array as an argument 
3) Make sure to close your Scanner object


-setArrayListElement(String[] inArray) - void
NOTE-OK to create local vars inside the method (ie double total)
1) Use a for each or for loop to parse inArray elements and total
	a) HINT - Double.parseDouble will be helpful
2) Add total to weeklyNumber.  HINT - .add will be helpful

+writeOutput() - void
NOTE-OK to create local vars inside the method.  See lab write up for suggestions.  Since doing a min and max, set min and max to first element in weeklyNumber.  HINT - .get(0) will help here
1) Use a for loop to:
	a) Get elements from weeklyNumber and total up (ie totalSales).  
	HINT - .get will be helpful
	b) Test min and max and set minWeek and maxWeek to the index as necessary.  Review
	Lab5 Grades for min/max strategy.
	c) Print out Week X data.  HINT-Each element in the weeklyNumber is the weekly sales and you have a DAYS_OF_WEEK. How can these two be used to calculate average daily sales?
2) After the for loop, print out:
	a) Total Sales - format nicely
	b) Weekly Sales  - format nicely  HINT- .size() will be helpful
	c) Print out min week and max week.  HINT-Indices are based on 0 and weeks start with 1.
